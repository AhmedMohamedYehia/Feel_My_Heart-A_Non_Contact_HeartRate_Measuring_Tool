# Feel_My_Heart-A_Non_Contact_HeartRate_Measuring_Tool

<p>
<strong>Feel My Heart</strong> project deals with the problem of remotely measuring heart rates. 
It is safely assumed that almost half of the population in many countries suffer from a 
lack of suitable equipment at a time when vital signs measurements are urgently 
needed. In addition, quite a good percentage of people suffer from the feeling of 
discomfort when dealing with vital signs measuring equipment. In order to contribute 
to our community, we chose to help those people by enabling them to measure their 
heart rate (HR) conveniently at any time with only the availability of a webcam without 
any contact sensors. This is possible based on the idea that blood has different light 
absorption capabilities with respect to the skin. As a result, the skin color changes as 
the blood volume in the arterioles grows. A basic RGB video camera can capture 
these changes.

We are proud to present version one of Feel My Heart. It has been successfully
implemented and tested. It consists of three main modules that handle face detection, 
images and signals, and heart rate estimation. The design is flexible and easily 
extendable to include other services based on the heart rate reading. The current 
results are competitive with similar projects. We look forward to its adoption by many 
noting that not only do patients need to measure their heart beat but also athletes and 
anyone exercising
